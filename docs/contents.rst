Welcome to SSF Particle2Fluid Shader Util's documentation!
==========================================================

This is a Unity shader plugin, not a fluid physics simulation plugin. It is used to render particle data into a smooth liquid surface.
It is suitable for rendering simulation systems that use particles as simulation units.



It has the following very good properties:

* Excellent real-time operation efficiency
* Excellent surface effect
* Open data customization interface
* Complete documentation and improvement guidelines
